### vcf

Scripts to work with [VCF 4.2](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf) files. All scripts require the [PyVCF package](https://pyvcf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and are written in Python 3.5.

These were written with the genome of _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_ in mind, and certain elements may be hardcoded as such.
